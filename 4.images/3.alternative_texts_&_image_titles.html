    <h1>These are images (use the &lt;img&gt; tag which does not need to be closed):</h1>
    <img src="./image.jpg" alt="This is a correctly loaded image" title="Correct loading">
    <img src="./img.jpg" alt="This is an incorrectly loaded image" title="Incorrect loading">
    <p>The "alt" attribute usually provides a description of the image in case it fails to load (it is also important for blind people who use assistive technologies that read these alternative texts for them).</p>
    <p>The "title" attribute simply describes what the image is about (the description appears when the image is hovered). This attribute can be used in any HTML element.</p>
